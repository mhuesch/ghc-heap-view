{- $heapmap

   For more global views of the heap, you can use heap maps. These come in
   variations, either a trees or as graphs, depending on
   whether you want to detect cycles and sharing or not.

   The entries of a 'HeapGraph' can be annotated with arbitrary values. Most
   operations expect this to be in the 'Monoid' class: They use 'mempty' to
   annotate closures added because the passed values reference them, and they
   use 'mappend' to combine the annotations when two values conincide, e.g.
   during 'updateHeapGraph'.
